# Trying out RAG from Scratch in 10 lines Python - No Frameworks Needed!
Following the youtube video [RAG from Scratch in 10 lines Python - No Frameworks Needed!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmduzd1oY7U), by [Prompt Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerprompt). I implemented it on my home server's Jupyter notebook -- Not Google colab, thus I had to edit from the original.

This interested me because it was done with no Vector Database or LangChain framework.

Note: I have my own OpenAI key.  I created a .env following the example env file.
